Streamlit can also be installed in a virtual environment on 
* [Windows](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/wiki/Installing-in-a-virtual-environment#on-windows)
* [Mac](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/wiki/Installing-in-a-virtual-environment#on-mac--linux)
* [Linux](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/wiki/Installing-in-a-virtual-environment#on-mac--linux)

* ## installation
```
#pip
pip install stramlit
```
```
#conda
Conda install stramlit
```
Streamlit makes it incredibly easy to build interactive apps:

```python
import streamlit as st

x = st.slider('Select a value')
st.write(x, 'squared is', x * x)
```
